# Notes by me
## Authentication vs. Authorization
<p>In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.</p>
<p>Authencation - indentity of user</p>
<p>Authorization - have a/c of user, ready to access</p>
